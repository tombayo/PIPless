#PIPless

PIPless is a tiny application framework forked from [Gilbert Pellegrom's PIP](http://gilbitron.github.com/PIP/). PIPless is modified to use GET-variables and static objects for an even simpler framework. It is also designed to work directly with RedBeanPHP [http://readbeanphp.com](http://redbeanphp.com).

## Requirements

* PHP 5.4 or greater

## Installation

* Download PIPless and extract
* Navigate to `application/config/config.php` and fill in your `base_url`
* Point your browser to your `base_url` and hopefully you'll see a welcome message.
* If you want to use a database just fetch the [RedBeanPHP Toolbox](http://redbeanphp.com/api/class-RedBeanPHP.ToolBox.html) using Controller::initDB()
